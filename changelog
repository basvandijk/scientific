0.3.4.9
	* Support QuickCheck-2.9.

0.3.4.8
	* Make bytestring-builder's installation conditional based on a Cabal flag.

0.3.4.7
	* Unconditionally export Data.ByteString.Builder.Scientific.
	  The bytestring-builder cabal flag has been removed.
	  Depend on bytestring-builder for backwards compatibility for GHC < 7.8.

0.3.4.6
	* Made toDecimalDigits more similar to floatToDigits

	  Previously:

	    toDecimalDigits 0 == ([0],1)

	  Now:

	    toDecimalDigits 0 == ([0],0)

	  Because:

	    Numeric.floatToDigits 10 (0 :: Double) == ([0],0)


	* Introduce a special case for 0 in fromFloatDigits

	    fromFloatDigits 0 = 0

	  This should fix https://github.com/bos/aeson/issues/369

0.3.4.5
	The following are all a courtesy of Oleg Grenrus (phadej):

	* Support GHC-8.0.1
	* Support binary-0.8
	* Enable Travis continuous integration

0.3.4.4
	* Improved performance of toDecimalDigits by 13%.

0.3.4.3
	* Fix build with integer-simple.

0.3.4.2
	* Fix build on GHC-7.4.
	  Courtesy of Adam Bergmark..

0.3.4.1
	* Fix build on GHC-7.0.4

0.3.4.0
	* Added fromRationalRepetend & toRationalRepetend
	  for safely converting from and to rationals
	  which have a repeating decimal representation like:
	  1 % 28 = 0.03(571428).
	* Added a Binary instance.
	* Various performance improvements.
	* Support vector-0.11
	* Support tasty-0.11
	* Support criterion-1.1.0.0

0.3.3.8
	* Support QuickCheck-2.8.

0.3.3.7
	* Fixed both the

            Prelude Data.Scientific> reads "0.0" :: [(Data.Scientific.Scientific,String)]
            [(0.0,".0"),(0.0,"")]

          problem and the

            read " 8" :: Scientific fails, while read " 8" :: Double succeeds

	  problem.

0.3.3.6
	* Fixed bug in the x / y method for Scientific. Since I was using
	  the default implementation: `x * recip y` the operation would
	  diverge when `recip y` had an infinite decimal output.
	  This shouldn't happen when the result of / is finite again.
	  For example: 0.6 / 0.3 should yield 2.0.

	  This is now fixed by using the following implementation:

	  `x / y = fromRational $ toRational x / toRational y`

0.3.3.5
	* Fixed bug when converting the Scientific:
	  `scientific 0 someBigExponent` to a bounded Integral using toBoundedInteger
	  or to a bounded RealFloat using toBoundedRealFloat.
	  If someBigExponent was big enough to trigger the big-exponent protection
	  the beforementioned functions didn't return 0.

	  This is fixed by explicitly handling a coefficient of 0.

0.3.3.4
	* Relax upper version bounds of base and deepseq
	  for the test suite and benchmarks.

0.3.3.3
	* Add support for `deepseq-1.4`.

0.3.3.2
	* Fix parsing of empty digit string (#21).

0.3.3.1
	* Allow newer tasty, tasty-hunit and criterion.

0.3.3.0
	* Add the isFloating or isInteger predicates.
	  Courtesy of Zejun Wu (@watashi).
	* Add the toRealFloat' and toBoundedInteger functions.
	  Courtesy of Fujimura Daisuke (@fujimura).

0.3.2.2
	* Enable package to link with integer-simple instead of
	  integer-gmp using the -finteger-simple cabal flag.
	  Courtesy of @k0ral.

0.3.2.1

	* Parameterize inclusion of the Data.ByteString.Builder.Scientific
	  module using the bytestring-builder flag. Disabling this flag
	  allows building on GHC-7.0.4 which has bytestring-0.9 installed
	  by default.

0.3.2.0

	* Add the floatingOrInteger function
	* Fix build on GHC-7.0.4
	* More efficient and better behaving magnitude computation
	* Lower the number of cached magnitudes to 324 (same as GHC.Float)

0.3.1.0

	* Don't normalize on construction but do it when pretty-printing
	  instead. Also provide a manual normalize function.
	* Improve efficiency of toRealFloat
	* Added note about caching magnitudes
	* Dropped dependency on arithmoi
	* Make benchmark easier to build
	* Add junit XML output support (for Jenkins)

0.3.0.2

	* Lower the minimal QuickCheck version.
	* Make sure sized exponents are generated in the QuickCheck tests.

0.3.0.1

	* Fix build for bytestring-0.10.0.*

0.3.0.0

	* Fix a DoS vulnerability that allowed an attacker to crash the
	  process by sending a scientific with a huge exponent like
	  1e1000000000.
	* Fix various RealFrac methods.
	* Cache some powers of 10 to speed up the magnitude computation.
	* Normalize scientific numbers on construction.
	* Move the Text Builder to its own module &
	  provide a ByteString builder
	* Added more documentation

0.2.0.2

        * Widen the dreaded pointlessly tight upper bounds

0.2.0.1

	* Support the latest versions of smallcheck and tasty

0.2.0.0

	* added deriving data

0.1.0.1

	* Loosen upper bounds on package versions

0.1.0.0

	* Fixed bugs & Changed API

0.0.0.2

	* Support building the library on GHC >= 7.0.1

0.0.0.1

	* Simplification in the Show instance
	* Optimization in fromRealFloat

0.0.0.0

	* Initial commit
